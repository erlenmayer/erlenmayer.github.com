	It all started with a bean bursting with the life-force of personal passion and entrepreneurial energy. In 1994, Mr. Steve D. Benitez, President and CEO of Bo's Coffee, dreamt of sharing his coffee experience in the United States and Europe to the local market. June 28, 1996 saw the opening of the first store of Bo's Coffee at Ayala Center Cebu, Cebu City, Philippines. It has since grown branching out into major urban areas of the Philippines.  Bo's Coffee now operates 58 outlets strategically located in Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, Iloilo, Bohol, Tacloban, Tagaytay, Samar and Zamboanga.
