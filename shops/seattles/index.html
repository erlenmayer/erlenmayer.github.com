	Seattle hasn’t always been the center of the coffee universe. In fact, we used to serve as much bad coffee as the rest of the country. This began to change in the early ’70s, when our founder bought a secondhand peanut roaster and started roasting Arabica coffee at the Wet Whisker on Seattle’s Pier 70. His personal tastes in coffee were simple—he wanted it to be bold and full-flavored, but also smooth and mellow. So that’s how he roasted and blended his coffee—bold and smooth. After the coffee craze took off in Seattle, a local restaurant held a taste-off among the major roasters to crown “the best cup of coffee in Seattle.” Much to our delight, our coffee took first place. To celebrate the occasion, we changed our name to Seattle’s Best Coffee. Today, good coffee is fashionable everywhere, but we still believe that our customers prefer Seattle’s Best Coffee because of its Uncommonly Smooth™ taste.
